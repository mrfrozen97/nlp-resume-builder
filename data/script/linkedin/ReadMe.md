# linkedin-job-scrap.py
- Implements the scrape_linkedin_url function to scrape a single  job posting on linkedin.
- I have manually collected links for SDE intern job postings online and pass them throught scrape_linkedin_url function and stored the data in a json file.
- To imitate the results for any other role, refer to the scrape_software_interns function.

# Steps to scrape Linkedin
- Collect Links from Linkedin that you want to scrape: Click the share button on the job posting and copy it (for example "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/41366799981")
- Create a txt file with links (follow the software_intern_links example)
- Call the function in the linkedin-job-scrape.py file (follow the software intern example already written)
