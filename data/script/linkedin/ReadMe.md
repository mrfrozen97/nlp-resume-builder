# linkedin-job-scrap.py
- Implements the scrape_linkedin_url function to scrape a single  job posting on linkedin.
- I have manually collected links for SDE intern job postings online and pass them throught scrape_linkedin_url function and stored the data in a json file.
- To imitate the results for any other role, refer to the scrape_software_interns function.
