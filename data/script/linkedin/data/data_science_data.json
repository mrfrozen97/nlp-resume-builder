It is maintained by the Gradio team within Hugging Face.\u00a0We are currently working on a suite of AI tools to help users quickly understand and write Gradio code.The first is the Playground: a code editor on our website which can generate or update complete Gradio demos based on a user's query.\u00a0The main objective for a Machine Learning Engineering intern will be to expand this effort. We can leverage :500k Gradio spaces and thousands of existing prompts from users to build a sophisticated model pipeline with the proper context of how Gradio works.\u00a0More and more developers are relying on LLMs for assistance in writing code, but these LLMs often do not have proper context on how Gradio works. Gradio has evolved from a library to an ecosystem for machine learning developers, with custom components contributed from our community, Python and JS clients, and Gradio Lite. To advance these efforts and as Gradio's usage and developer community grows, it's important to invest in tools that can help users learn, build and contribute to Gradio.About YouYou're passionate about open source and making advanced ML tools accessible. You are someone who stays up to date with the latest machine learning trends and models. You love experimenting and have a high bias for action and results.\u00a0Some of our requirements for this role : Experience using modern deep learning libraries and LLM APIs and understanding tradeoffs between different models and APIs Knowledge of how to fine-tune LLMs, create retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, and use re-rankers for two-stage retrieval You're comfortable exploring and contributing to a codebase consisting of Python and Svelte-flavored JavaScript You have a \"product mindset\" -- like experimenting with different user interfaces to build products that are useful to to hundreds of thousands of users\u00a0 If you're interested in joining us, but don't tick every box above, we still encourage you to apply!

We are building the fastest growing platform for AI builders with over 5 million users & 100k organizations who collectively shared over 1M models, 300k datasets & 300k apps. Our open-source libraries have more than 400k+ stars on Github.About the RoleHugging Face maintains a large collection of open source machine learning libraries, including transformers, diffusers, and datasets, just to name a few. However, these are all implemented in Python, meaning they aren't as easily accessible to JavaScript/TypeScript developers. So, in order to grow the Hugging Face ecosystem, we decided to build projects like transformers.js and huggingface.js with the primary goal of bridging the gap between web development and machine learning. WebML (Web Machine Learning) unlocks a range of new possibilities for building web applications by enabling models to run locally in the browser. Combining on-device machine learning with the plethora of APIs that browsers provide, empowers developers to create low-latency, interactive, and privacy-focused applications that can scale and reach users without them needing to install anything! This internship operates at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and open-source community building. The focus will be to expand the Hugging Face ecosystem to web developers through the creation and maintenance of easy-to-use JS/TS machine learning libraries. By the end of the internship, the candidate will have touched on many aspects of web machine learning, including: converting and optimizing models for in-browser inference (ONNX, quantization), enabling models to run in-browser at near-native speeds (WebGPU, WebNN, WASM), building demo applications to showcase new features, and fostering a collaborative open-source community.About YouIf you love open-source but also have an eye for art and creativity, are passionate about making complex technology more accessible to engineers and artists, and want to contribute to one of the fastest-growing ML ecosystems, then we can't wait to see your application!If you're interested in joining us, but don't tick every box above, we still encourage you to apply!
