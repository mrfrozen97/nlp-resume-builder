# SPECIFICITY,
specificity is the keyword that we have to keep in mind, this is why we are building this project!!!
---
## Here are some important pointers which need further exploration:
- a. Keyword Research (Role & Industry Specific):  This is crucial. Our tool needs to help users identify the exact keywords that ATS are likely to be scanning for.
    - 1. Strategic Keyword Integration (LLM-Guided)
    - 2. Job Description Analysis
    - 3. Industry Trend Analysis (Data-Driven)
- b. ATS-Friendly Formatting (Minimize Parsing Errors)
- c. Skill Section Optimization (ATS Skill Dictionaries)
- d. Experience & Project Description:
    - 1. Mimic Job Description Language (Subtly)
    - 2. Quantifiable Results
    - 3. Action Verb Optimization

## Tech that we will mostlikely need or want to integrate:
- RAG for a1 and a3
- CAG for Job desc., Keywords
- MoE use case: utilize expert subnetworks to generate distinct sections of the resume (e.g., one expert for skills, one for experience, one for formatting).
