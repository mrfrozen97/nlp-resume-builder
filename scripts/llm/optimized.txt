Okay, so I need to help optimize Alex Chen's resume based on the given rules. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, look at the job description for the AI internship at Mojave Technologies. They mention a focus on data analysis, machine learning, AI, Python, and cloud technologies. So, I should make sure that these keywords are integrated naturally into the resume.

Alex's original resume starts with his contact info, then education, technical skills, projects, experience, extracurriculars, and then he needs to add the job description at the end as bullet points. 

Rule 1 says to replace the current job title in the header with one that best matches the target job. Since it's an AI internship, maybe "AI Engineer" or something similar.

Next, each existing bullet point should start with a strong action verb. Past roles get past tense, ongoing ones present. So for his experience as an IT Support Intern and Teaching Assistant, I'll change those verbs.

For quantifying achievements, only add numbers if already present. Looking at the projects, maybe he can quantify the impact or outcomes if possible, but since they're mostly descriptive, perhaps not necessary here unless there's data available.

He has some technical skills in Java, Python, etc., so I need to integrate more relevant ones like machine learning technologies and cloud platforms as per the job description. Also, adding a few logically implied techs without introducing unrelated ones.

In the projects section, he worked on an e-commerce site with HTML/CSS/Javascript and a weather data visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib. Maybe I can add quantifiable aspects if possible. For example, "Analyzed 1M+ data points" or something similar, but since it's not provided, maybe just keep the projects as is.

The experience bullets need to be more action-oriented. Instead of "Provided technical support," use a past tense verb like "Resolved." Also, changing "Assisted with setting up" to "Set up."

In extracurriculars, make sure they're relevant and concise. Maybe add something about AI or machine learning if possible.

Finally, in the job description section, he needs bullet points highlighting his skills and experience related to the job. So list out the key technologies and projects that align with Mojave Technologies' requirements.

I also need to ensure that all keywords from the ATS are included naturally. For example, "Data Analysis," "Python," "Machine Learning," "Cloud Platforms" should be part of the skills or project descriptions.

Let me go through each section step by step:

1. Header: Replace Software Developer with AI Engineer.
2. Education remains same.
3. Technical Skills:
   - Add more relevant techs like NLP, TensorFlow if not already present.
   - Ensure all listed tools fit the job description.
4. Projects:
   - Modify project descriptions to include action verbs and quantifiable achievements if possible.
5. Experience:
   - Use past tense for each bullet point.
6. Extracurriculars: Maybe add something related to AI or data analysis if applicable.

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure the resume accordingly, making sure to follow all the rules without adding any explanations.
